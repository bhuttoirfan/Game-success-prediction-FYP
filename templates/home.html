						<h6>Project Intro</h6>
						<p>
							<br>
							Video games are one of the most popular sources of entertainment within our society.
							With the evolution of science and technology the demand of better-quality contents
							with respect to improved graphics and more real-life experience have increased for video
							games. Such demand from users has led to high production cost, ultimately leading to higher
							business risk for the development companies. In order to minimize this risk this research
							proposes a machine learning approach towards video game success before the initial release. <br><br>
							We are working on training machine learning model to predict whether the game, developers
							are going to develop will be a success or not. We will be focusing of different features like
							game genre, category, price, platform etc. So, developers know ahead of time, what specifically
							are they going to develop and what path they should take.

						<h3>Multi Linear Regression</h3>
						<p>Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a
							statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of
							a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the
							linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response
							(dependent) variable. <br>
							In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS)
							regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.</p>

				<div class="offset-lg-2 col-lg-5 offset-md-2 col-md-5">
					<div class="frequent_item">
						<h3>Random Forest Classifier</h3>
						<p>Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for both
							classification as well as regression. But however, it is mainly used for classification
							problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees means more
							robust forest. Similarly, random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data
							samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects the best
							solution by means of voting. It is an ensemble method which is better than a single
							decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5">
					<div class="frequent_item">
						<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
						<p>Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict
						the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is
						dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.<br>
						In simple words, the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as
						either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).<br>
						Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X. It is
						one of the simplest ML algorithms that can be used for various classification
						problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc.</p>

						<h3>K-Near Classifier</h3>
						<p>K Nearest Neighbor is one of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning. Machine learning
							models use a set of input values to predict output values. KNN is one of the simplest forms of
							machine learning algorithms mostly used for classification. It classifies the data point on how
							its neighbor is classified. <br><br>
							KNN classifies the new data points based on the similarity measure of the earlier stored
							data points. For example, if we have a dataset of tomatoes and bananas. KNN will store similar
							measures like shape and color. When a new object comes it will check its similarity with the
							color (red or yellow) and shape.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5">
					<div class="frequent_item last-child">
						<h3>Support Vector Machine</h3>
						<p>
							A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses
							classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM
							model sets of labeled training data for each category, they’re able to categorize new text.
							<br> <br>
							Compared to newer algorithms like neural networks, they have two main advantages:
							higher speed and better performance with a limited number of samples (in the thousands).
							This makes the algorithm very suitable for text classification problems, where it’s common to
							have access to a dataset of at most a couple of thousands of tagged samples.
							<br><br>
							A support vector machine takes these data points and outputs the hyperplane (which in two
							dimensions it’s simply a line) that best separates the tags. This line is the decision boundary:
							anything that falls to one side of it we will classify as blue, and anything that falls to the other as red.

						<h3>Artificial Neural Network</h3>
						<p>An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons,
							which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses
							in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives
							a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The "signal" at a connection is
							a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of
							its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts
							as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.
							Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that
							threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different
							transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last
							layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.</p>
